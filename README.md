Introduction
------------
LinConnect is a project to mirror *all* Android notifications on a Linux desktop using LibNotify.

*Please note that this is my first time using Python (though I do have experience in other languages), so the code may still be messy. It's a WIP.*

Please note, this is a work in progeress, it will be a fork of hauckwills linconnect-server, that is actualy a program indicated in your notification area.

You will be able to latest notification, aswell as see history of notifications.

It will be possible to change settings on this one aswell, from the drop down menu that it provides.
